# Passphrase
Use Passphrase to generate a passphrase for SSH or GPG keys. For example, on
the command-line, run

    $ passphrase --num-words=4
    dokusi uolgo allunga totalisa

or programmatically,

```ruby
require "passphrase"
p = Passphrase::Passphrase.new(number_of_words: 4)
passphrase = p.passphrase
```
Passphrase also has the capability to generate passwords (indirectly).

## Installation
The Passphrase command-line tool and library can be installed with

    $ gem install passphrase

However, because the gem is cryptographically signed to prevent tampering, the
preferred installation command should include the `--trust-policy` security
option, which causes the gem to be verified before being installed. To invoke
this option, you must first add my public key `esumbar.pem` to your list of
trusted certificates, as follows.

    $ gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esumbar/passphrase/master/certs/esumbar.pem)

Finally, specify the appropriate security level when installing.

    $ gem install passphrase --trust-policy MediumSecurity

Using `MediumSecurity` rather than `HighSecurity` omits dependent gems, in
this case `sqlite3`, which is not signed, from the verification process.

## Basic usage
### Command-line tool

    $ passphrase --help
    Usage: passphrase [options]
        -n, --num-words=NUM           Number of words in passphrase 3..10

        -r, --[no-]random-org         Use RANDOM.ORG to generate random numbers
                                      (default: --no-random-org)
        -h, --help                    Show this message
        -v, --version                 Show version

    $ passphrase
    sinmak termyne ismus affidavo recur

    $ passphrase -n 4
    apaisado vermouth seemag ebelik

    $ passphrase -n 3 -p
    pothvati alewives escatima
    pothvati_alewiNes_e&cat5ma

### Ruby library

```ruby
require "passphrase"

# generate a passphrase with default options
p = Passphrase::Passphrase.new
puts "passphrase: #{p}"
puts "passphrase internals: #{p.inspect}"

# generate three four-word passphrases using RANDOM.ORG
options = { number_of_words: 4, use_random_org: true }
p = Passphrase::Passphrase.new(options)
passphrase1 = p.generate.passphrase
passphrase2 = p.generate.passphrase
passphrase3 = p.generate.passphrase

# generate an array of six-word passphrases
passphrase_array = Array.new(100)
Passphrase::Passphrase.new(number_of_words: 6) do |p|
  passphrase_array.map! { |e| p.generate.passphrase }
end

# generate a password
p = Passphrase::Passphrase.new(number_of_words: 3)
passphrase = p.passphrase
password   = passphrase.to_password
```

## Background
### Diceware Method
Passphrase implements the [Diceware
Method](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) which constructs a
passphrase by randomly selecting words from a predefined list of more-or-less
meaningful words. Because the words are meaningful, the resulting passphrase
is easier to remember and type. And because the selection is random, it is
more secure. The more words in a passphrase, the better. However, four or five
is optimal.

The original Diceware wordlist from 1995 contained only English words. Since
then, [Diceware-compatible wordlists in other
languages](https://blog.agilebits.com/2013/04/16/1password-hashcat-strong-master-passwords/expanded-dicelists/) have been published and are incorporated
into Passphrase. Unfortunately, the enhanced security of the result comes at
the expense of having to deal with words from potentially unfamiliar languages.
_Note that these are not merely translations of the original Diceware
wordlist._

Passphrase includes wordlists in the following 15 languages (stored in an
SQLite 3 database file).

1. Afrikaans
2. Croatian
3. Czech
4. Diceware (the original Diceware wordlist)
5. English
6. Finnish
7. French
8. Italian
9. Japanese
10. Latin
11. Norwegian
12. Polish
13. Spanish
14. Swedish
15. Turkish

Except in the original Diceware list, all words are lower case, comprised of
characters from the ascii set `[a-z]`. The original Diceware list includes
some "words" with numerical and punctuation characters. To the best of my
knowledge, no word appears more than once in this set of wordlists.

The _dice_ in Diceware refers to the act of rolling a die to achieve
randomness. A sequence of five consecutive rolls has 7776 (6<sup>5</sup>)
possible outcomes. Each combination maps to one line in a given wordlist, and
each line, in turn, is composed of between 1 and 15 words (depending on the
language, the average being 5).

Therefore, to select a word, Passphrase

1. randomly selects one of 15 languages
2. randomly selects one of 7776 lines from the corresponding wordlist
3. randomly selects one word from the corresponding line

This leads to roughly 2<sup>66</sup> (10<sup>28</sup>) possible five-word
passphrases, for example.

Passphrase simulates the rolls of a die by using random numbers from one of
two sources. The default is to use the standard SecureRandom class. You also
have the option of requesting random numbers from
[RANDOM.ORG](http://www.random.org). However, because RANDOM.ORG depends on
network access, it is susceptible to network problems, and is also slower.

### Passwords
A typical passphrase will not satisfy password policies that require the use
of upper case letters, numbers, and special characters (~, !, and the like).
Therefore, Passphrase gives you the option to replace three randomly selected
characters in a generated passphrase with one random upper case letter
([A-Z]), one random integer ([0-9]), and one random special character. Spaces
are not usually allowed either, so they are replaced with underscores as part
of this process.

## Contributing to Passphrase
After forking the [repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/esumbar/passphrase), go to your local copy of the
repository  and execute `bundle install` to ensure that all development gems
are installed.

Then, run `rake database` to create and populate the wordlist database. Note
that even though raw data files for Hungarian and Swahili exist, these
languages are excluded from the database because they do not have a full
compliment of 7776 entries.

To run the command-line tool within the repository directory, try `ruby -Ilib
bin/passphrase`. You can also experiment with the library in irb. For example,

    $ irb -Ilib -rpassphrase
    >> p = Passphrase::Passphrase.new(number_of_words: 3)
    => {:passphrase=>"jazzy vannier viscount", :number_of_words=>3, ... }
    >> p.passphrase
    => "jazzy vannier viscount"
    >> p.passphrase.to_password
    => "jazz{_2annier_vBscount"

Run the tests with `rake spec`.
